This network is intended to classify handwritten digits after being trained with data from the MNIST dataset. There are countless improvements that could be made to it, but this was really meant more as a learning experience than anything, and the inefficient way
I did everything was to help me get a deeper understanding of how neural networks work, rather than get lost in optimizations and abstractions. Unfortunately, although it seems like the network is training, as of July 7 it doesn't seem to converge
on a local minima regardless of how long it is trained.
